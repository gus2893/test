# ADR: Normalize Renewal data and use `facility_entity` Table as Source for Facility Data

## Status
Approved

## Context
Initially, our renewal data included facility information stored in a JSON column in our database. While this approach centralized all data into a single table, it presented significant limitations:
- Querying renewal data became cumbersome and inefficient.
- Facility data was duplicated, leading to potential inconsistencies.

To resolve these issues, we identified the need to normalize the data, enabling efficient querying of renewals while reducing duplication. During this process, we discovered that the `facility_entity` table, managed externally, already contained the same facility data stored in our JSON column.

A team meeting was held with **Kurt** and **Brendan** to discuss and seek approval to use the `facility_entity` table as the authoritative source of facility data. This approach would eliminate duplication and improve maintainability.

## Decision
1. **Use the `facility_entity` table as the source of truth for facility data:**
   - Instead of storing facility data in a JSON column, we will reference the `facility_entity` table directly.
   - This ensures data consistency across systems and reduces redundant storage.

2. **Introduce a join table to manage relationships between renewals and facilities:**
   - A new table will be created to link renewal records with entries in the `facility_entity` table.
   - This join table will normalize the data and enable efficient querying of renewal and facility relationships.

## Consequences
### Benefits
- **Improved Query Efficiency:** Renewal data can now be queried directly using relational joins, avoiding the overhead of parsing JSON.
- **Data Consistency:** Facility data is managed in a single authoritative source (`facility_entity` table), reducing the risk of discrepancies.
- **Simplified Maintenance:** Normalizing data simplifies schema management and aligns with relational database best practices.

### Trade-offs
- **Increased Dependency:** The system now depends on the `facility_entity` table's availability and accuracy. Any changes to its schema or data could impact our system.
- **Migration Effort:** Existing renewal records with embedded facility data will need to be migrated to the new schema.

## Implementation Plan
1. Update the schema to include:
   - A join table for renewals and `facility_entity` relationships.
2. Migrate existing renewal data:
   - Extract facility data from the JSON column and map it to the corresponding entries in the `facility_entity` table.
3. Refactor application logic to query and store relationships using the join table and `facility_entity` table.
4. Coordinate with the `facility_entity` table owners to monitor changes and ensure compatibility.

## Follow-up
- Schedule a follow-up review with Kurt and Brendan post-implementation to confirm the new integration aligns with expectations.
- Monitor system performance and validate data consistency after the migration.
