User Profile and Profile Creation Documentation

Overview

This document outlines the functional requirements, happy path, logic flow, and error handling for the User Profile and Profile Creation pages of the application.

User Profile Page

Functional Requirements

The User Profile page allows users to:

View their profile details and settings.

See pending requests if any profile changes are awaiting approval.

Edit specific profile details: Function Area, Role, and Selected Markets.

Save or cancel changes made to their profile.

Happy Path

User logs into the application and clicks the profile icon on the navigation bar.

A dropdown appears; the user selects the profile option, which opens a new window displaying their profile.

The user sees all their current information. If there are pending requests, they see a red warning message and the pending changes instead of their current data.

If the user reverts to their current data, the warning message disappears, and they see their most up-to-date information.

The user enters edit mode where Function Area, Role, and Selected Markets become editable:

Markets are displayed and sorted vertically.

Selecting "Select All" without filtering selects all markets.

Filtering by region and then selecting "Select All" selects only the filtered markets.

Selecting "Select All" overrides all filters to select all markets.

The user enters edit mode, which triggers an API call to fetch all Function Areas and their associated roles in a single request:

The Function Area and Role fields should display the user's current inputs, and the Role field resets to "None" only if the user changes their Function Area.

The user selects a Role from the updated list.

Changing Function Area again clears the Role field.

The user saves their changes, which sends a request and displays the warning message about pending approval.

If the user cancels, the system checks for unsaved changes and prompts the user before discarding.

Logic Flow

Navigation: Clicking the profile icon opens a dropdown leading to the profile page.

Data Fetching: The system fetches user data, including pending requests if applicable.

Display Profile: Current data is displayed unless pending requests exist, in which case pending data is shown.

Edit Mode: The user enters edit mode where:

Function Area and Role options are fetched together in a single API call.

Markets display vertically, with options to filter and select all.

Changes to Function Area reset the Role field.

Save Changes: Saving sends the updated data for approval and displays a warning message.

Cancel Changes: Cancelling prompts the user if unsaved changes exist; otherwise, it reverts to the original profile page.

Profile Creation Page

Functional Requirements

The Profile Creation page allows new users to:

See a welcome message when first accessing the page.

Navigate to the profile creation form, which mirrors the edit profile page but starts with blank fields.

Save their changes, transitioning to a confirmation view where they can review and finalize their data.

Confirm their data, redirecting them to an unconfirmed dashboard with limited functionality while their profile is approved.

Happy Path

The user logs in for the first time and sees a welcome message.

The user clicks "Next," triggering a backend update to set the welcome variable to true in their profile.

The system navigates the user to the Profile Creation page, displaying a blank form.

The user completes the profile form:

Function Area and Role options are fetched via API and left blank initially.

The user selects a Function Area and Role, populating relevant fields.

The user selects markets as needed.

The user clicks "Save" and is navigated to a confirmation view.

The confirmation view displays the user’s inputs and a message: "You can still make changes if anything is incorrect."

The user chooses to:

Click "Edit," returning to the edit profile page with their current inputs pre-filled.

Click "Confirm," finalizing their data and navigating to the unconfirmed dashboard.

Logic Flow

Welcome Message:

The welcome message is displayed upon first login.

Clicking "Next" updates the backend to set welcome to true and navigates the user to the Profile Creation page.

Profile Creation Form:

Display a blank form for the user to input their details.

Fetch Function Area and Role options via API.

Save Changes:

Save the user’s inputs and navigate to the confirmation view.

Confirmation View:

Display the saved inputs and provide options to edit or confirm.

"Edit" navigates back to the edit profile page with pre-filled current inputs.

"Confirm" redirects to the unconfirmed dashboard, restricting functionality until approval.

Error Handling

Unsaved Changes:

Prompt: "You have unsaved changes. Do you want to proceed without saving?"

Changes we can add

API Failure:

Display: "Unable to fetch options. Please try again later."

Save Failure:

Display: "An error occurred while saving your profile. Please try again later."

Validation Errors:

Highlight invalid fields and display error messages.
